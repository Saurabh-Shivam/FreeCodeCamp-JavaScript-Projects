              Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that
              data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application
              uses various types of data structures in one or the other way.
              This tutorial will give you a great understanding on Data
              Structures needed to understand the complexity of enterprise level
              applications and need of algorithms, and data structures.

            <h3 class="subContent">Why to Learn DSA?</h3>
            <p>
              As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three
              common problems that applications face now-a-days.
            </p>
            <ul class="bulletPointContainer">
              <li>
                Data Search - Consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a
                store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search
                an item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the
                search. As data grows, search will become slower.
              </li>
              <li>
                Process speed - Processor speed although being very high, falls
                limited if the data grows to billion records.
              </li>
              <li>
                Multiple Requests - As thousands of users can search data
                simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while
                searching the data.

              Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of
              instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired
              output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying
              languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one
              programming language.

            <p>
              If you are still willing to set up your environment for C
              programming language, you need the following two tools available
              on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subContent">Text Editor</h3>
            <p>
              This will be used to type your program. Examples of few editors
              include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS,
              and vim or vi.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name and the version of the text editor can vary on different
              operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows,
              and vim or vi can be used on Windows as well as Linux or UNIX.
            </p>

            <p>
              The files you create with your editor are called source files and
              contain program source code. The source files for C programs are
              typically named with the extension ".c".
            </p>

            <p>
              Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text
              editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer
              program, save it in a file, compile it, and finally execute it.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subContent">The C Compiler</h3>
            <p>
              The source code written in the source file is the human readable
              source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", to turn into
              machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program
              as per the given instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              This C programming language compiler will be used to compile your
              source code into a final executable program. We assume you have
              the basic knowledge about a programming language compiler.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most frequently used and free available compiler is GNU C/C++
              compiler. Otherwise, you can have compilers either from HP or
              Solaris if you have respective Operating Systems (OS).
            </p>

            <p>
              The following section guides you on how to install GNU C/C++
              compiler on various OS. We are mentioning C/C++ together because
              GNU GCC compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subContent">Installation on Windows</h3>
            <p>
              To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install
              MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,
              <a style="all: unset; color: blue" href="www.mingw.org">
                www.mingw.org,</a
              >
              and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the
              latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be
              named MinGW-&lt;version&gt;.exe.

              To get started with DSA learn basics of Programming, open the VS
              Code and write your first "Hello world" C code:

                printf("Hello World"); <br />
                return 0; <br />
                }
            </code>
            <h3 class="subContent">Variables</h3>
            <p>
              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your
              application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
              to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              In C, identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
              dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
              Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
              characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
              through "z" (lowercase)
            </p>

            <code class="codeContent">
              int num = 57; <br />
              char ch = 'A'; <br />
              float decimal_num = 45.7; <br />
            </code>

            <h3 class="subContent">if...else statement</h3>
            <p>
              Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition
              is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if
              the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code class="codeContent">>
              if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
            </code>
            <p>
              You may also compound the statements using else if to have
              multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
            </p>
            <code class="codeContent">>
              if (condition_1) { statement_1; } <br />
              else if (condition_2) { statement_2; } <br />
              else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } <br />
              else { statement_last; }

            <p>
              Array is a type of linear data structure that is defined as a
              collection of elements with same or different data types. They
              exist in both single dimension and multiple dimensions. These data
              structures come into picture when there is a necessity to store
              multiple elements of similar nature together at one place.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The difference between an array index and a memory address is that
              the array index acts like a key value to label the elements in the
              array. However, a memory address is the starting address of free
              memory available.

              If arrays accommodate similar types of data types, linked lists
              consist of elements with different data types that are also
              arranged sequentially. <br />
              But how are these linked lists created? <br />
              A linked list is a collection of "nodes" connected together via
              links. These nodes consist of the data to be stored and a pointer
              to the address of the next node within the linked list. In the
              case of arrays, the size is limited to the definition, but in
              linked lists, there is no defined size. Any amount of data can be
              stored in it and can be deleted from it.
            </p>
            <p>There are three types of linked lists -</p>
            <ul class="bulletPointContainer">

                Doubly Linked List - The nodes point to the addresses of both

              </li>
              <li>
                Circular Linked List - The last node in the list will point to
                the first node in the list. It can either be singly linked or
                doubly linked.

        <section class="main-section" id="Stack_Data_Structure">
          <header>Stack Data Structure</header>
          <article class="content">
            <p>
              A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), that is popularly used in
              most programming languages. It is named stack because it has the
              similar operations as the real-world stacks, for example - a pack
              of cards or a pile of plates, etc
            </p>
            <p>
              The stack follows the LIFO (Last in - First out) structure where
              the last element inserted would be the first element deleted.
            </p>
            <h3>Basic Operations on Stacks</h3>
            <p>
              Stack operations usually are performed for initialization, usage
              and, de-initialization of the stack ADT.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most fundamental operations in the stack ADT include: push(),
              pop(), peek(), isFull(), isEmpty(). These are all built-in
              operations to carry out data manipulation and to check the status
              of the stack.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stack uses pointers that always point to the topmost element
              within the stack, hence called as the top pointer.
            </p>
            <h3>Insertion: push()</h3>
            <p>
              The push() is an operation that inserts elements into the stack.
              The following is an algorithm that describes the push() operation
              in a simpler way.
            </p>
            <h4>Algorithm</h4>
            <code class="codeContent">>
              <p>
                1. Checks if the stack is full. <br />
                2. If the stack is full, produces an error and exit. <br />
                3. If the stack is not full, increments top to point next empty
                space. <br />
                4. Adds data element to the stack location, where top is
                pointing. <br />
                5. Returns success.
